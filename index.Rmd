Hello! I am Taylor Wooten! 
I am currently a student at UVU studying biotechnology and chemistry. I am currently working as a quality assistant at a microbiology lab, learning and earning my ASQ certification. I am petrifilm certified. 
I played D1 softball for two years at UVU before deciding to fully focus on my education and my career. 
Here you will find links to pages!
